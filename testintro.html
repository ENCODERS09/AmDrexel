		<p>This survey functions as a way for the Management Team at Verve Systems to identify specific soft skills you have in the workplace. Soft skills are a set of traits that help an individual interact with other people effectively. Â Many individuals have high achieving technical backgrounds, which easily qualifies them for a job, however they need to be able to work efficiently and effectively with the others in the organization.</p>

		<p>Through communications with the Management team, we have determined that the most important soft skills they want their current and prospective employees to possess are communication, adaptability, emotional intelligence, work ethic, interpersonal skills, and work ethic. The results of the survey will indicate to the Management Team which of these soft skills you will need improvement on.</p>
